	
With this assignment, each group is expected to develop a desktop application in which it is possible to apply the maximum of object-oriented programming concepts that have been studied this semester.

Thus, the application to be developed should contain, at least, the following classes:

- One superclass, if possible with protected attributes and class attributes.

- At least two subclasses of the previous superclass.

- If possible, a subclass of one of the previous subclasses.

Each class should have constructors with parameters, without parameters, and copy constructors.

Access methods (getters and setters) must be defined for all classes.

The 'this' reference and the 'this()' method should be used.

The superclass must override the toString(), clone(), and equals() methods inherited from the Object class. The superclass should also have a method designated as print() to print its attributes.

The subclasses must override the print() method inherited from the superclass. The subclasses should use the 'super' reference and the 'super' method.

In addition to the classes mentioned above, interfaces and/or abstract classes should also be defined.

The application should apply the concept of polymorphism. In particular, it should exemplify the process of dynamic method lookup or dynamic method dispatch using a Java array or collection (e.g., ArrayList).

The application must have a graphical interface.

The application should be something that could be used in a real context with functionalities that make sense to its potential users. The purpose and usefulness of the application should be clear (who could use the application? in what context? to do what?).

Before starting the development of the project, each group must validate the chosen theme for the application.

Each group must use the GitHub tool to maintain the project code.

After submitting the application in Inforestudante, each group will make a presentation/demonstration of the application (max. 10m).
